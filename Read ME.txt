compile the  "App_Server.java"
this is the code for creating two threads 1 for sending,reading messages and sleeping for 1 sec

but while receiving the messages from the sim card its throwing some Exceptions.

the file "sending_data.txt" contains the data in the format "phone_no,text_message" line by line to send multiple messages

the file "received_data.txt" will be generated automatically if there are some msgs in the sim

BUGS :(  
: if u want to send multiple messages( except the very 1st message) and while reading the sim this code is facing some exceptions 
App_server.java where u need to optimize the code ...
thank u..
